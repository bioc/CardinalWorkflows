@article{Tibshirani2002,
abstract = {We have devised an approach to cancer class prediction from gene expression profiling, based on an enhancement of the simple nearest prototype (centroid) classifier. We shrink the prototypes and hence obtain a classifier that is often more accurate than competing methods. Our method of ‘‘nearest shrunken centroids’’ identifies subsets of genes that best characterize each class. The technique is general and can be used in many other classification problems. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show that the method was highly efficient in finding genes for classifying small round blue cell tumors and leukemias.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for class prediction in DNA microarray studies based on an enhancement of the nearest prototype classifier. Our technique uses "shrunken" centroids as prototypes for each class to identify the subsets of the genes that best characterize each class. The method is general and can be applied to other high-dimensional classification problems. The method is illustrated on data from two gene expression studies: lymphoma and cancer cell lines.},
